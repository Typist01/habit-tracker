## Project goals
The three members involved in creating this project all graduated from Sparta global's training course and were awaiting deployment, which sparked the idea to work on a project together,

### Personal goals
- Maintain and improve Java skills by developing a backend to a SQL Database using Spring and Hibernate.
- Learn HTML, JavaScript, Node.js and react by developing a front-end user interface.
- Establish a way to connect the aforementioned frontend to the Java based backend.
- ~~Keep ourselves entertained working on a fun project~~
